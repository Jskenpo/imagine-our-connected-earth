# The Changing World 

The Changing World project is a web-based platform that aims to provide engaging and accessible information about Earth's systems, their global interconnections, and the impact of climate change. The platform includes interactive features, multimedia content, and real-world examples from NASA's Earth-observing satellites.

## Project Structure

### Components:
- **About Section**: Describes the mission and vision of the Earth Information Center, and introduces the team.
- **Air Quality Section**: Showcases videos and information on the causes and effects of air pollution and how it impacts human health, ecosystems, and climate change.
- **Before and After (BandA) Section**: Provides before-and-after comparisons of environmental changes using a slider for visualizing the effects of climate change.
- **Home Section**: Includes a dynamic title with a liquid effect and a video to welcome users to the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **PrimeReact**: UI library for React, used for components like Fieldset.
- **React-Before-After-Slider**: A package for creating before-and-after sliders.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **HTML5 Video**: For displaying climate-related videos in various sections.

## Pages

### Home
The homepage features a liquid-text animation and an embedded video. The text scales dynamically based on the window size for responsive design.

### About
The About page gives an overview of the Earth Information Centerâ€™s mission, the work being done, and introduces the team. It also includes a background gif of Earth and a structured layout using PrimeReact Fieldsets.

### Air Quality
This page highlights the impact of air pollution through videos and information on both causes and effects. It presents data on pollutants and their adverse effects on health and the environment.

### Before and After (BandA)
The Before and After section allows users to compare visual representations of environmental changes, such as glaciers and volcanic activity, using an interactive slider.
